              As a part of a development team I am mostly focused on developing microservices and APIs linking various components of Deeptale infrastructure. Also I was the main developer of the QA Platform which main goal was to enhance graphics team performance by adding user friendly interface and well-optimized REST API endpoints.

              Main achievements:
              - Developed QA web application that had a significant impact on the performance of the graphics team
              - Proposed & implemented architecture for microservices
              - Improved API design and configurability

              Tech stack:
              - Python (FastAPI, Pydantic, Celery, poetry)
              - Docker & Docker Compose
              - Google Cloud Platform
              - Vue, JavaScript
              - Make

              Other skills:
              - REST API design
              - Data structures
              - Algorithms
              - Machine Learning
              - Taking ownership

              During my time in STX I had the opportunity to work in two separate areas:

              Data Engineering:

              While working with data processing involving ETL pipelines, I managed to fix an inconsistency in one of the client's datasets by firstly gathering, transforming and analysing necessary data and then preparing and running loaders to make it live. 

              Development of internal management app:

              Worked together with a team of backend and frontend developers on enhancing user experience and implementing requested features. This involved bug fixes, adding new features and improving existing ones (ie. extending Google calendar integration). Tech stack consisted of Django, Pyramid, SQLAlchemy and Docker. My greatest achievement was that users could use internal systems more efficiently and without any additional stress.
                
              Technology stack:
              - Python (pandas, plotly, Django, Pyramid, SQLAlchemy)
              - Docker & Docker Compose
              - Jupyter

              Together with my team we were working on full-stack web application with Vue, Flask and MongoDB. 
              My greatest accomplishment was reduction in time complexity of an endpoint, by one order of magnitude, by carefully designing architecture, which led to substantially better responsiveness.
